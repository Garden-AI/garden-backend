How to create scopes if you have the Garden Client ID and secret:
https://action-provider-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setting_up_auth.html#step-3-create-your-action-provider-s-scope

We have two scopes for Garden right now: 
`https://auth.globus.org/scopes/0948a6b0-a622-4078-b0a4-bfd6d77d65cf/test_scope` and `https://auth.globus.org/scopes/0948a6b0-a622-4078-b0a4-bfd6d77d65cf/action_all`.

The action_all scope was created with the scope in scope.json. The test_scope scope was created with test_scope.json.
